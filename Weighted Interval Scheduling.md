**Input:** Like interval scheduling each request i has start and finish times $s_i$ and $f_i$. Each request i also has an associated value or weight $v_i$

$v_i$ might be:
- the amount of money we get from renting out the resource
- the amount of time the resource is being used ($v_i = f_i - s_i$)

==Find: A maximum-weight compatible subsets of requests==
