**Three steps to [[dynamic programming]]:**
1. Formulate the answer as a recurrence relation or recursive algorithm
2. Figure out the possible values of parameters in the recursive calls
	- Can use [[Memoization]] to store a cache of previously computing values
3. Specify an order of evaluation for the recurrence so that you already have the partial results stored in memory when you need them

[[Fibonacci Numbers]]
[[Weighted Interval Scheduling]]
