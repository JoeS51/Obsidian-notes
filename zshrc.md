The `.zshrc` file is a configuration file for the Z shell (zsh) - a popular alternative to bash, especially on macos

- it's executed every time you start a new terminal session. It controls:
	- env vars
	- aliases and functions
	- plugins and themes (oh my zsh)
	- auto start commands like neofetch

[[Oh My Zsh]]
