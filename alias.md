An **alias** in the terminal is a **shortcut** for a longer command â€” it lets you type something short and easy instead of a long or complex command.

- Can throw the alias in .zshrc or .bashrc and it'll let you use that alias anywhere

==Used an alias called cursor to open cursor instead of vs code==
