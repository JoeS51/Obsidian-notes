Daybooks are used to take notes in meetings, jot down what we're working on, not variable values when debugging, to leave reminders where we put things, to record wild ideas, and sometimes just to doodle

Has three benefits:
1. It is more reliable than memory
2. It gives you a place to store ideas that aren't immediately relevant to the task at hand. That way you can continue to concentrate on what you are doing, knowing that the great idea won't be forgotten
3. It acts as a rubber duck. When you stop to write something down, your brain may switch gears, almost as if talking to someone. 

Try to keep an engineering daybook. Use paper because there is something special about the act of writing compared to typing
