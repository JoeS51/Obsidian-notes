 A language is statically typed if the type of a variable is known at compile time. For some languages this means that you as the programmer must specify what type each variable is; other languages (e.g.: Java, C, C++) offer some form ofÂ _type inference_, the capability of the type system to deduce the type of a variable (e.g.: OCaml, Haskell, Scala, Kotlin).

Examples:
- C, C++, Java, GO
