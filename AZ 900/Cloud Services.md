Data 
Application
Runtime
OS
H/V
Compute

All of these are needed for any application

For [[on-prem]], the customer is responsible for managing everything
For [[Iaas]], we are only worried down to the OS and Azure handles the rest
For [[PaaS]], only focused on the data and application
For [[SaaS]], an actual application (Microsoft 365). You don't have to worry about anything you just use it
