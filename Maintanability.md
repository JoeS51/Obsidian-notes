the majority of the cost of software is not in its initial development, but in its ongoing maintenance like fixing bugs, keeping its systems operational, investigating failures, adapting it to new platforms, repaying technical debt, and adding new features

**We should design software in such a way that it will minimize pain during maintenance, and thus avoid creating legacy software ourselves.**
Three important design principles for software systems:
1. Operability: make it easy for operations teams to keep the system running smoothly
2. Simplicity: make it easy for new engineers to understand the system, by removing as much complexity as possible
	- one good way of doing this is [[Abstraction]].
3. Evolvability: make it easy for engineers to make changes to the system in the future. *Also known as extensibility*
