1. Quick 15 minute call for general questions
2. API Design interview
	1. Was asked to create a server in any language with two parts:
		1. Create a server that takes requests and hashes the input body with any hash. Figure out how to use caching to make requests faster and additionally add rate limiting to limit to 2 request per user every 5 seconds.
		2. Create servers for rate limiting now. Create three servers that handle rate limiting for users. (tests load balancing)
