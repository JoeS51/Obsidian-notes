**Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs)** provide an abstraction of a local procedure call to the developers by hiding the complexities of packing and sending function arguments to the remote server, receiving the return values, and managing any network retries.

==RPC allows developers to build applications on top of distributed systems. Developers can use the RPC method without knowing the network communication details. As a result, they can concentrate on the design aspects, rather than the machine and communication-level specifics.==
