Enforcing project standards is important for maintaining code quality, consistency, and scalability in a react app. 

- **Eslint**
	- ESLint serves as a valuable linting tool for JavaScript, helping developers in maintaining code quality and adhering to coding standards. 
	- By configuring rules in the `.eslintrc.js` file, ESLint helps identify and prevent common errors, ensuring code correctness and promoting consistency throughout the codebase. 
	- This approach not only helps in catching mistakes early but also enforces uniformity in coding practices, thereby enhancing the overall quality and readability of the code.
- **Prettier**
	- Prettier is a useful tool for maintaining consistent code formatting in your project.
	- By enabling the "format on save" feature in your IDE, code is automatically formatted according to the rules set in the `.prettierrc` configuration file.
