*stands for python debugger*

**itâ€™s the built-in debugging tool that comes with Python. You use it to pause your program, inspect variables, step through code line by line, and diagnose bugs interactively.**

`import pdb; pdb.set_trace()`
- sets the breakpoint at that line and then you can step through it in the console
