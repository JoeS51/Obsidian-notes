## Reproducing Bugs
- The best way to start fixing a bug is to make it reproducible. ==We want a bug that can be reproduced with a *single command*==

**Failing Test Before Fixing Code**
- sometimes isolating the circumstances that display the bug will give you insight on how to fix it

**Read the Error Message**

**You probably caused the error not somebody else's code**

"The amount of surprise you feel when something goes wrong is proportional to the amount of trust and faith you have in the code being run. That's why, when faced with a 'surprising' failure, you must accept that one or more of your assumptions is wrong. Don't gloss over a routine or piece of code involved in the bug because you 'know' it works. Prove it. Prove it in this context, with this data, with these boundary conditions"
