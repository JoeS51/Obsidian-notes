- Learning how to make money, a far more valuable skill, I submit, than the ability to invent 
- Another simple example of an often repeated successful business model involves the old "razor and razor blads" strategy made famous by Gillette
	- The razors are sold at cost, and all the money is made on the blades

==Arbitrage businesses== basically these businesses exist to take advantage of some pricing disparity in the marketplace
- example: MCI telecommunications which was formed to offer long idstance service at a lower price than AT&T
- taking advantage of arbitrage opportunites is a viable and potentially profitable way to enter a business. All arbitrage opportunities go away though. 
- The trick in these businesses is to use the arbitrage profits to build a more enduring business model

- business is like chess: to be successful, you must anticipate several moves in advance in order to have any chance. 
	- A business plan that describes an insuperable lead or a proprietary position is by definition written by naive people
- you want opportunities that offer the prospect of high, safe returns on modest investment, with lots of attractive and proprietary growth options - a simple rule to describe, but one that is almost impossible to follow in the real world

When an investor looks at business plan:
- they look that the entrepreneurial team is aware of the context and how it helps or hinders their specific proposal
- Looks for sensitivity to the fact that the context will inevitably change
