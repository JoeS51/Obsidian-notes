A **heartbeat message** is a mechanism that helps us detect failures in a distributed system. If there’s a central server, all servers periodically send a heartbeat message to it to show that it’s still alive and functioning. If there’s no central server, all servers randomly select a set of servers and send that set a heartbeat message every few seconds. This way, if there are no heartbeat messages received for awhile, the system can suspect there might be a failure or a crash.
