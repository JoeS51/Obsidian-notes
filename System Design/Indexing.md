*Indexing is about making data faster to query. In many systems, we can tolerate slow writes but we can't tolerate slow reads. Indexing is the process of creating a data structure that makes reads faster*

- Vector databases are used to index high-dimensional data. This is useful for systems that need to do things like find similar images or similar documents
- [[ElasticSearch]] is the recommended solution for secondary indexes
